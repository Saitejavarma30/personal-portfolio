        I implemented a prototype for Load Balancing of streaming data across
        multiple servers with varying priorities and input loads, ensuring
        efficient resource utilization and seamless data processing. Leveraging
        Apache Kafka and Azure Event Hubs, I developed a robust solution that
        dynamically manages server priorities and input loads without requiring
        server restarts, significantly improving system flexibility and reducing
        downtime. This innovation streamlined data streaming operations and
        enhanced the reliability and scalability of the platform, ensuring
        uninterrupted service even in high-load scenarios.`,
