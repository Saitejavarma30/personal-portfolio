During this time, I also worked with Python and started taking ownership of projects previously managed by my team."

I also led the migration of a legacy Django project into a React-based micro frontend. One of my key achievements was optimizing a computational job, reducing its runtime from 9 hours to 3 hours, which allowed me to dive deep into Apache Spark.  I also took on backend projects, such as building my own HTTP server and implementing a Redis-like system."

Additionally, I contributed to the migration of our backend infrastructure from JDK 8 to JDK 17, optimizing performance and security. This year also marked my increased involvement in system design discussions, contributing to the planning and scalability improvements of various projects. 2025 also marked as the year where i have done my first open source contribution"
